# Blog comparison between 2 age groups

This is a natural language processing project where comparison is made between blogs of teens and blogs of adults in their 40's. A visible difference is seen between the use of the vocabularies of both age groups.

Blogger data has been used for this purpose. Since blogger data is available in the form of XML file, we need to extract all the blog posts to create 2 corpus. One for teens and one for the adults.
